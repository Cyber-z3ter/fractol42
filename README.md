# fractol42

## Description:

This repository contains an interactive program written in C that generates and displays various types of fractals. Fract-ol utilizes mathematical formulas to render visually stunning fractal patterns, including the Mandelbrot set, Julia set, Burning Ship, and more.

## Key Features:

Generation and visualization of different fractal types using complex mathematical algorithms.
Real-time rendering of fractals with graphical representations using [graphics library name] (or specify the library used).
User-friendly interface allowing interactive exploration of fractals (zoom, color schemes, parameter adjustments).
Keyboard and mouse controls for seamless user interaction and exploration of fractals.
Optimized rendering techniques for efficient visualization, ensuring smooth performance even for complex fractals or high resolutions.
## Purpose:

Designed as a programming project to explore graphical programming, mathematical algorithms, and computational mathematics.
Provides hands-on experience in C programming, graphical libraries, and visual representation of complex mathematical concepts.
Encourages exploration and understanding of fractals and their visual patterns.
## Usage:

Clone the repository and compile the source code using a compatible C compiler and the required graphical library.
Run the compiled program to explore and visualize different fractal types.
Use the interactive interface to manipulate fractals and observe changes in real-time.
## Note:

This repository contains solutions specific to the project requirements and might be part of a programming course.
Contributions, improvements, or suggestions to enhance fractal generation or visualization are welcome.
